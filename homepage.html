            UN satellite images find evidence that suggests manufacturing of weapons of mass destruction might be
            happening somewhere in Eastern Europe. Security Council will be discussing starting a deeper investigation
            into the matter in the following weeks. Office of the Spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General
            refused to comment at this time.

            Glow in the dark jewelry popular in Czech Republic

            In Czech Republic, everyone has been absolutely crazy about the glow in the dark jewelry recently. The
            rising price, however, makes it less and less accessible each week, as the supply seems to be running out.
            The manufacturer simply cannot keep up with the demand. The spokesperson of the Czech company
            "Chernobizuterie" said they are planning to open another factory in Fukushima, Japan, to meet the increased
            demand.
