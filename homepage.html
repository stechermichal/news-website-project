            UN satellite images find evidence that suggests manufacturing of weapons of mass destruction might be
            happening somewhere in Eastern Europe. Security Council will be discussing starting a deeper investigation
            into the matter in the following weeks. Office of the Spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General
            refused to comment at this time.

            Glow in the dark jewelry popular in Czech Republic

        <p>
            In Czech Republic, everyone has been absolutely crazy about the glow in the dark jewelry recently. The
            rising price, however, makes it less and less accessible each week, as the supply seems to be running out.
            The manufacturer simply cannot keep up with the demand. The spokesperson of the Czech company
            "Chernobizuterie" said they are planning to open another factory in Fukushima, Japan, to meet the increased
            demand.

            supposed to attend the funeral of Prince Philip and gift Queen Elizabeth II a glow in the dark commemorative
            coin. His complication began on plane flying to Great Britain and immediately after arriving to Great
            Britain he was taken to a hospital. In the St. Thomas' Hospital it was discovered he is suffering from a
            severe radiation poisoning. Investigation was launched immediately to find if there were foreign powers
            involved

            A new religious group has been established in Europe, church registered under the name "The Church of Three
            Eyes", a name taken from the fact many of its members have grown an extra eyes after worshipping their
            holy rock. Supposedly members grow many limbs and deformities, but upon further inquiry, the spokesperson
            said the name "The church of many limbs and inexplicable deaths from radiation poisoning" would simply
            be too long

            Scientists claim the popular glow in the dark jewelry and rocks are actually made out of uranium, a highly
            dangerous chemical element that can cause radiation poisoning and even death. World Health Organization
            responded to our inquiry for further comment with: "What? They are wearing uranium as jewelry? This is a
            joke right, there is no way this is actually happening. What news station are you from so I can avoid you
            like your webpage is radioactive too.

            Anyone who has invested in the glowing green rocks is surely very happy with their decision right now. In
            past 7 days glowing green rock, sold under the NASDAQ ticker $URAN, has gone up by 1237% as of right now.
            Economists say it is the best investment of our century, as due to its nature it can never go down in price.
            Most people who buy it in its physical form, like gold, suddenly fall ill, leaving them in no condition
            to ever be able to sell their $URAN, which drives the price up.

            In the past few weeks many people have become convinced of the healing properties of glowing green rocks
            and the jewelry made from them, often wearing them as healing gadgets. However, could we overdo it?
            Recent finding say yes. A picture taken at manufacturing facility shows a huge chunk of the glowing
            green rocks, that can be dangerous to approach. In other words, maybe think about whether you really need
            two rings on each finger made out of glowing green rocks.

            EUFA has announced its plans to replace classic footballs used during matched with round shaped glowing
            green rocks. This has left many confused, but the general reception has been positive. We asked EUFA
            spokesperson for a comment: "The green rocks seem to make people grow more limbs. Our reasoning is simple:
            More green rock balls, more legs, more football."
